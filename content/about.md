Hi, I'm Hoang Nhut.

**Software Developer | Passionate about Golang and Backend Development**

After two years in the software industry, I've come to realize how important English, Communication, Reporting skills are. This insight has significantly impacted my career, leading to a few **"thank you"** letters along the way.

That's why I started this blog: to improve my English and writing skills while sharing my knowledge with everyone. I hope you find it helpful!

About my blog, **ZorO** has two meanings.

First, it represents **Zero or One** akin to bits in computing --- the very essence of computers.

Second, it's inspired by Roronoa Zoro, the vice captain of the Straw Hat Pirates. I admire Zoro for his hard work, cool demeanor, and dedication to achieving his dreams.

Here's a famous quote from Zoro:

> Only I Can Call My Dream Stupid.
>
> When I decided to follow my dream, I had already discarded my life.

Thank you!
